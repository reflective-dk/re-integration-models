            A System Access represents a role, a unit or some other aspect of a
            access that may be granted to a system. System Accesses are grouped
            together in System Access Profiles and are allocated to Employments
            through a System Access Allocation

                System Accesses are categorized according to the aspect of the
                access they represent. Although different systems have different
                access models, there are elements that always apply to a certain
                extent. We use this to present a unified access view across all
                systems.
